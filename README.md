Post-install / post-boot for BeagleBone Black

- Download the image from http://beagleboard.org/latest-images
- Un-`xz` the image. On OSX I use "The Unarchiver.app" available in the App Store.
- Format the SD-card. On OSX I use "SDFormatter.app" from the SD Association (https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/).
- Put the `.img`-file on the SD-card. I like to use "ApplePi-Baker.app" from http://www.tweaking4all.com/hardware/raspberry-pi/macosx-apple-pi-baker/
- Eject the SD-card and slip it into the BeagleBone Black.
- Apply power
